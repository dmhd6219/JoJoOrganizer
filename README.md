## Overview

JoJo Organizer is a unique and unconventional desktop alarm application 
that features unusual visuals, an engaging user interface, and various fun elements
to make waking up an enjoyable experience. The app includes an Obama prism on the main screen, 
a moving window that prevents the app from being easily closed, bass-boosted music, and many more surprises!

## Features

- **Obama Prism:** The main screen displays a mesmerizing Obama prism visual effect that changes colors over time.

- **Moving Window:** When attempting to close the app, the window playfully moves around, making it challenging to close. The idea is to encourage users to interact with the app and fully wake up before being able to close it.

- **Bassboost Music:** The alarm is accompanied by bass-boosted music to give you an energetic start to your day.

- **Customizable Alarms:** Set multiple alarms with different themes and wake-up tunes.

- **Intuitive Interface:** The app features an easy-to-use and visually appealing interface.

- **Dark Mode:** The app offers a dark mode for users who prefer a darker color scheme.
